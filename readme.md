Basic implementation of merkle tree in python.
In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a 
tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash 
of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the
cryptographic hash in the labels of its child nodes.
Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the 
contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a 
generalization of hash lists and hash chains.
